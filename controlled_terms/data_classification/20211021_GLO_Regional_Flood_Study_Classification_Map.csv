They are often placed to mark the divisions between sovereign governments and political jurisdictions, such as countries, states, counties, cities or local zoning units. These geographic entities may be delineated based on a common culture and history, language, systems of governance, or a long-standing result of trade, conflict or war."

,Zoning,,,,Zoning,Land Cover / Land Use / Zoning,"Land use and land cover are commonly referenced in the same conversation because they are inherently related. Land cover typically refers to the physical landscape and its dominant vegetation, whereas land use describes the modification and management practices applied to the land for economic purposes in human geography. The two prevailing methods for determining land cover characteristics are field surveys and the interpretation of imagery collected by satellites and aircraft.  Zoning is a method to administer land use in which a jurisdiction, typically a city, designates areas or zones where certain land uses are permitted or prohibited. Some zones are single use (residential, industrial) and some are designated for mixed-use."

Land-based transportation networks and their related infrastructure are the central factors impacting emergency management response, recovery and mitigation."
,Parcels,,,,Parcels,Land Parcels,"A land parcel represents the legal boundaries of a unit of property defined for the purpose of tracking ownership and real estate title, land use, land value and taxation. In Texas, the land parcel polygons, which are frequently edited and updated using geographic information systems, are maintained by central appraisal districts at the local county level often with the assistance of private sector vendors."
