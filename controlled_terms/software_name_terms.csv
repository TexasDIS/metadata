HEC-RAS,Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System,https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/,"This software allows the user to perform one-dimensional steady flow, one and two-dimensional unsteady flow calculations, sediment transport/mobile bed computations, and water temperature/water quality modeling.",U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,model
HEC-HMS,Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modeling System,https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-hms/,"The Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) is designed to simulate the complete hydrologic processes of dendritic watershed systems. The software includes many traditional hydrologic analysis procedures such as event infiltration, unit hydrographs, and hydrologic routing. HEC-HMS also includes procedures necessary for continuous simulation including evapo-transpiration, snowmelt, and soil moisture accounting. Advanced capabilities are also provided for gridded runoff simulation using the linear quasi-distributed runoff transform (ModClark). Supplemental analysis tools are provided for model optimization, forecasting streamflow, depth-area reduction, assessing model uncertainty, erosion and sediment transport, and water quality.",U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,model
