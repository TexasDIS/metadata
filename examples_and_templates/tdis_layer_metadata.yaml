  accessibility: 5,Data are accessible online via service endpoints (see controlled vocabulary csv file reference)
  attribute_accuracy: Attributes are approximately 90% complete. Some fields have missing values. HWM types were evaluted with an automated comparison to the notes and description fields. A handful were reclassified in the Type_Reclass field. Note: many null values are null on purpose, for instance, not all water marks need additionl notes
